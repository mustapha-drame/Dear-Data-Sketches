# Dear-Data-Sketches
You are looking at my Dear Data Sketches (Well... I only have one for now but let's us be optimistic)

In this Creative Coding project, I wanted to represent a personal experience during my classes. As a student, I can focus on the lecture for about 45 minutes, but after that, my attention begins to wander. Though I still listen, it’s only vaguely, and I find myself noticing small details around me like the colours, my classmates' outfits, and their shoes. These visual details often captivate my attention.

In the spirit of creative coding, I decided to capture these moments by creating a Processing sketch. It represents how my focus shifts throughout the class, using colours that I found captivating. I created an eye at the center of the screen, with a black pupil, to symbolize my own eye. Surrounding the eye are twelve circles, each representing a different colour that caught my attention. To make it visually structured, I calculated precise angles for each circle’s placement around the eye. Additionally, I added an arrow pointing from the eye to the circle in the direction my gaze was focused.

The project also includes a fun element: the song associated with the "I’m just a chill guy" meme. This song mirrors my mood during class, making it a fitting background track. You can play or pause the song by pressing the 'c' key on your keyboard.
There also the fact that if you click your mouse in the circle, they all turn blue. Why do you think I did that ? Well it's my favourite colour, beside black...

This sketch is a simple yet qualitative representation of how my attention is drawn to colours and distractions in class, and how I used my coding skills to illustrate that experience. Cheers !
